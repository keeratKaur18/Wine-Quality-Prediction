# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Abstract 
The goal is to create a system that can accurately and consistently predict wine quality
using chemical information. We used a dataset from Kaggle that detailed the chemical
make-up of various wines and their rankings in terms of quality to tackle this issue.
The project will involve collecting and pre-processing a dataset of wine samples with
known quality ratings. The model will be evaluated against various
performance metrics, such as accuracy and precision, to determine its effectiveness in
predicting wine quality.
Being a classification problem, we developed predictive models using a variety of
machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient
Boosting, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to
build predictive models. We also used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature
selection and analysis.

The main findings of the project indicate that machine learning algorithms, specifically
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier & Decision Tree can be successfully
applied to predict wine quality based on chemical properties. The performance of the
models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, after
which hyperparameter tuning was done and the highest accuracy of 94% was
achieved using Random Forest.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to make the model more
accessible to non-technical users. It was developed using the Tkinter
library in Python, and it allows users to input wine features and obtain a
predicted wine quality score.
