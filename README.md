# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Abstract 
The goal is to create a system that can accurately and consistently predict wine quality
using chemical information. We used a dataset from Kaggle that detailed the chemical
make-up of various wines and their rankings in terms of quality to tackle this issue.
The project will involve collecting and pre-processing a dataset of wine samples with
known quality ratings. The model will be evaluated against various
performance metrics, such as accuracy and precision, to determine its effectiveness in
predicting wine quality.
Being a classification problem, we developed predictive models using a variety of
machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient
Boosting, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to
build predictive models. We also used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature
selection and analysis.
